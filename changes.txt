Version 0.8
-----------
Todo before release:
- updating the documentation

New features/ improvements:
- case-insensitive matching with `pstringCI`, `charsTillStringCI`, etc.
  (using the Unicode 1-to-1 case folding mappings for chars in the BMP)
- various new parsers and combinators, including `restOfLine`,
  `skipToString`, `manySatisfyMinMax`, `manyStrings`, `withSkippedString`
- new functions `runParserOnSubstring` and `runParserOnSubstream`
- various performance improvements
- F# 1.9.6.16 compatibility

Design changes:
- standardized on a single input stream type (`FParsec.CharStream`)
  and a single concrete parser state type (`FParsec.State`)
- refactored the `Reply<_,_>`, `ErrorMessage` and `ParserError` types:
  * error replies now also contain a complete `State`
  * whether a parser has changed the state is now determined by
    checking the input and the output state for equality, instead of testing
    the `Consumed` flag
  * replaced the `Reply<_,_>.Flags` with a `Status` field
  * replaced the various helper functions for constructing a `Reply` with
    three overloaded `Reply<_,_>` constructors (with different arities)
- all char parsers are now "newline aware", i.e. they normalize
  any of the three standard newline representations ("\n", "\r\n", "\r")
  to "\n" and they properly increment the line count whenever they parse
  a newline; this means that the BEHAVIOUR OF ALMOST ALL CHAR PARSERS HAS
  CHANGED WITH REGARD TO HOW NEWLINE CHARS ARE HANDLED

Bug fixes:
- The `CharStream` class now uses the serialization API to persist the decoder
  state for backtracking purposes. Previously it relied on the decoder loosing
  its state at block boundaries after a certain sequence of method calls. The
  previous approach works in practice for the .NET decoders of the standard
  unicode encodings and for simple stateless encodings like ASCII and ANSI,
  but it relies on undocumented behaviour and it does not work reliably for
  encodings like GB18030, ISO-2022 or ISCII.
- In previous FParsec versions the `CharStream` file path/System.IO.Stream
  constructors failed with an `IndexOutOfRange` exception when the file/stream
  was empty and encoding detection was not turned off
  (reported by Vesa Karvonen - thanks Vesa!).
- In previous FParsec versions the `NumberLiteral.String` returned by the
  `numberLiteral` parser included parsed suffix chars despite the
  documentation claiming the opposite. (The testing code was buggy too.)
  Applications that rely on this behaviour can now use the new 
  `NumberLiteralOptions.IncludeSuffixCharsInString` to force the 
  `numberLiteral` parser to include any suffix chars in the returned string.

Other breaking changes:
- renamed the module `CharParser` to `CharParsers`
- moved `CharParser.OperatorPrecedenceParser` into separate module

- FParsec.Primitives:
  * (SUBTLE CHANGE) renamed `message` to `fail` and `fail` to `failFatally`
  * renamed `pair`, `triple` and `quad` to `tuple2`, `tuple3` and `tuple4`
  * renamed `manyFoldLeft` to `manyFold` and changed the
    argument order of the accumulator and function argument
  * removed `manyFoldRight`
  * renamed `count` to `parray` and changed the return type,
    renamed `skipCount` to `skipArray`
  * renamed `followedBy` and `notFollowedBy` to `followedByL` and
    `notFollowedByL` and introduced `followedBy` and `notFollowedBy` functions
    that take no second argument
  * moved `ParserResult<_>` to `CharParsers` and changed constructor arguments
  * removed applyParser
  * removed `|>>=`, now `>>=` automatically uses an optimized branch for
    uncurried functions
  * removed `endBy` and `endBy1` (`endBy p sep` can be replaced with
    `many (p .>> sep)` and `endBy1 p sep` with `many1 (p .>> sep)`)

- FParsec.CharParsers:
  * removed `applyParser` from the public interface
  * removed `getIndex`, `skip`, `registerNL`, `extract`, `regexp`
    (these low-level operations should be done directly through the
    `State<_>`/`CharStream.Iterator` interface)
  * removed `anyCharOrNL` (no longer needed, see design changes above)
  * removed `nSatisfy` (can be replaced with `manySatisfyMinMax`)
  * removed `unicodeDigit` and `unicodeNumber` (can be replaced with
    `satisfy System.Char.IsDigit` and `satisfy System.Char.IsNumber`)
  * moved the helper functions `expectedError`, `unexpectedError` etc. into
    the `Error` module

- FParsec.CharStream:
  * string constructor takes more arguments
  * `Iterator.Peek(i)` now returns the `EndOfStreamChar` char instead
    of throwing an exception if the char peeked at lies before the beginning
    of the stream

Version 0.7.3.1, 2009-02-26
---------------------------
- Fixed a bug in `CharParser.normalizeNewlines`/`CharStream.NormalizeNewlines`.
  This bug also affected the `skipped` and `manyTillString` parsers, which
  internaly call `normalizeNewlines` to normalize the returned string.

  The bug was reported by Greg Chapman - thanks Greg!

  When given a multi-line string in which the lines are delimited by "\r\n" but
  the last line does not end in a newline, the buggy `normalizeNewlines`
  replaced the chars on the last line with '\n` chars.

- Changed the signature of `Helper.SkipOverWhitespace`.

Known issue:
- Visual Studio rebuilds the whole solution every time one
  tries to run the "Test" executable under the debugger.
  This behaviour is caused by a known bug in the F# Visual
  Studio plugin. I'm not aware of any workaround.

Version 0.7.3, 2008-12-08
-------------------------
Breaking changes (all of which should have little or no impact
on existing code bases):
- `CharStream.Iterator` instances now compare equal if and only if they belong
  to the same `CharStream` and point to the same index (previously they
  compared only equal if their internal representations were identical)
- the constructor argument of `Error.otherError` is now expected to be
  comparable with F#'s structural comparison function `compare`,
  see http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785725
- the signature of the second `ParserError.ToString` overload has changed
- `CharParser.errorToString` and `printErrorLine` have been deprecated

New features:
- reimplemented the error formatting code in `FParsec.Error`
- added new `State<_>.AdvanceTo` and `CharStream.Iterator.Advance` overloads
- slightly modified the error reporting in `Primitives.sepEndBy`
- some documentation fixes

Version 0.7.2, 2008-11-17
-------------------------

- added `CharParser.OperatorPrecedenceParser`
- changed the overflow checking in `pint32` such that it will
  not be affected by an expected future change in F#'s
  int32 -> uint64 conversion behaviour
- added `CharParser.pint16`, `puint16`, `pint8`, `puint8`
- changed the signatures in CharParser.fsi to use the `Parser<_,_>` type
  abbreviation
- fixed outdated documentation of `CharParser.expectedError`
- some minor optimizations

Version 0.7.1, 2008-09-29
-------------------------

Breaking changes:
- renamed `Primitives.Reply._tag` member to `Flags` and gave
  it a proper enumeration type
- `CharParser.State` is now a reference type
- Removed `CharParser.State.Flags` member
- deprecated `Primitives.reconstructError`

Version 0.7.0.1, 2008-09-23
---------------------------

Breaking change:
- changed the case of the `FParsec.Error.Pos` members
  (This wasn't already done in 0.7 because of an oversight.)

Version 0.7, 2008-09-13
-------------------------

Bugfixes:
- made `FParsec.Error.Pos` IComparable to prevent `ParserError.ToString`
  from throwing an exception under rare circumstances
- corrected the argument checking for some `CharStream.Iterator` methods
  for very large arguments

New features:
- compatibility with the F# CTP release
- a configurable parser for number literals: `CharParser.numberLiteral`
- `CharParser.pfloat` now also parses `NaN`, `Infinity` and
  hexadecimal floating point literals as supported by IEEE754r, C99 and
  Java (but different from the hex representation supported by F#)
- new helper functions `CharParser.floatToHexString`, `floatOfHexString`,
  `float32ToHexString` and  `float32OfHexString`
- integer parsers: `Charparser.pint32`, `puint64`, `puint32`, `puint64`
- new sample: a JSON parser
- various optimizations and some code cleanup
- new `CharStream.Iterator` members `ReadUntil`, `Increment` and `Decrement`
- new `State` member `AdvanceTo`
- new function `Primitives.createParserForwardedToRef`
- new combinator `|>>=` in `Primitives`

Breaking changes:
- renamed the parsers `char` and `string` to `pchar` and `pstring`
  (This is in deference to the built-in F# functions `char`
   and `string`, which weren't yet around when the first version
   of FParsec was released.)
- changed the case of the properties of the `Reply` and `State` types
  (This reflects the emerging consensus in the F# community that all
   public members of types should be named in PascalCase.)
- deprecated State.AdvanceNL (use the 3 parameter Advance overload instead)
- deprecated the `Primitives` helper functions `isOk`, `isEmpty`, ...
  (the `Reply` properties `IsOk`, `IsEmpty`,... should be used instead)
- deprecated the `CharParser` helper functions `matchChar`, `readChar`, ...
  (the `State.Iter` methods `Match`, `Read`, ... should be used instead)
- deprecated `Primitives.option`, `<|>$` should be used instead
- made `CharParser.CharList` internal (If you need this helper class for
  your code, just copy the implementation to your source.)
- State.Flags() now has more bits (and less bits are reset on a position change)

Version 0.6, 2008-05-20
-------------------------
- fixed a bug in `manyTillString` (the code keeping track of newlines was
  buggy)
- fixed a bug in CharParser.<?> (the error reporting was inconsistent with
  Primitives.<?> in the rare case where `<?>` is applied inside an
  `attempt (...) <?> label` clause to a parser that returns an EmptyOk reply)
- various changes for F# 1.9.4.15
- added `skipped` parser to `CharParser`
- added `nextCharSatifiesNot`, `prevCharSatifiesNot`,
  `currCharSatisfies`, `currCharSatisfiesNot` to `CharParser` module;
  the behaviours of the existing `nextCharSatisfies` and `prevCharSatisfies`
  were slightly changed (see fparsec.html for more details)
- added `TryWith` and `TryFinally` members to `Primitivs.ParserCombinator`
- added `triple` and `quad` parsers to `Primitives` module
- set CompilationRepresentationFlags.PermitNull for `Error.ParserError`
- various optimizations
- some documentation fixes, including corrections for the docs of
  the `CharParser` error generation helper functions (`expectedError` etc.)

Version 0.5.1, 2008-01-20
-------------------------
- added `pipe2`, `pipe3` and `pipe4` primitives
- replaced `count` and `skipCount` primitives with optimized versions
- minor optimizations in `spaces` and `spaces1`
- added `pfloat` char parser
- minor documentation fixes

Version 0.5, 2008-01-15
-------------------------
- Major design change: all lazy computations were removed and the types
  Output and Reply unified. The new implementation is considerably simpler
  and also compiles with F# 1.9.3.7.

-------------------------
- performance improvements in `CharStream.Iterator`
- minor documentation fixes

Version 0.4.1, 2008-01-02
-------------------------
- documentation fixes
- new sample application: a parser for Parsing Expression Grammars

- added `whitespace` parser and changed `unicodeWhitespace`
- added `spaces` parser (equivalent to `skipManyChars whitespace`)
- removed newlineRepl parameter from `manyTillString`
- added `skipManyTill` and `skipManyCharsTill`
