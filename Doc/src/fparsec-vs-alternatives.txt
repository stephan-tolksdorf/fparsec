[section FParsec vs alternatives]

The following tables contain a bullet-point comparison between FParsec and the two main alternatives for parsing with F#: parser generator tools (e.g. fslex & fsyacc) and "hand-written" recursive descent parsers.

[table Relative advantages

[[Parser-generator tools] [FParsec] [Hand-written[br] recursive-descent parser]]
[
[
- Declarative and easy-to-read syntax
- Ensures adherence to grammar formalism
- Can check for certain kinds of ambiguity in grammar
- You don't have to think about performance. Either the generated parser is fast enough, or not. There's not much you can do about it.
]
[
- Implemented as F# library, so no extra tools or build steps
- Parsers are first-class values within the language
- Succinct and expressive syntax
- Modular and easily extensible
- Extensive set of predefined parsers and combinators
- Semi-automatically generated, highly readable error messages
- Supports arbitrary lookahead and backtracking
- Runtime-configurable operator-precedence parser component
- Does not require a pre-parsing tokenization phase
- Comprehensive documentation
- Extensively unit-tested
]
[
- No extra tools or build steps
- Most amenable to individual requirements
- Potentially as fast as technically possible
- Parsers are relatively portable if you stick to simple language features and keep library dependencies to a minimum

[table Relative disadvantages

[[Parser-generator tools] [FParsec] [Hand-written[br] recursive-descent parser]]
[
[
- Restricted to features of grammar formalism
- Extra tools and compilation steps
- Reliance on opaque generator tool, that is often hard to debug, optimize or extend
- Static grammar that can't be changed at runtime
- Often hard to generate good error messages
- Many tools generate comparatively slow parsers
- Some tools have only limited Unicode support
- Portability problems
]
[
- Tradeoff between declarativeness and performance
- Syntax less readable than PEG or Regular Expression syntax
- [url "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion" Left-recursive] grammar rules have to be rewritten
- Does not support a pre-parsing tokenization phase
- You have to learn the API
- Limited to F#
- Code-dependence on FParsec
- Aggressive performance optimizations add complexity to parts of the lower-level FParsec source code
]
[
- You have to write everything yourself, which can take a lot of effort
- Implementing (fast) parsers requires some experience
- Expression (sub)grammars with infix operators can be ugly and inefficient to parse with
  a pure recursive-descent parser, so you might also have to write some
  kind of embedded operator precedence parser
