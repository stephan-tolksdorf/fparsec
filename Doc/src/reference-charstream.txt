[section#CharStream CharStream]

Provides read-access to a sequence of UTF-16 chars.

[interface-reference]

[section Interface]
[$$interface]
[/section]

[section Remarks]

The `CharStream` class provides a unified interface for efficiently reading UTF-16 chars from a binary stream or an in-memory char buffer (e.g. a string). It is optimized for the use in backtracking parser applications and supports arbitrary *char-based* seeking, even for streams larger than the addressable memory (on 32-bit platforms).

[** The `CharStream` class is the base class of `[^CharStream_1 CharStream<'TUserState>\ ]`], which adds a user-definable state component and some convenience methods for working with the state of a `CharStream` instance.

[#block-wise A `CharStream` constructed from a `[url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream.aspx" System.IO.Stream]` or a file path reads the stream block-wise and only holds the most recently accessed block in memory.] The blocks overlap in order to provide efficient access on the boundary between blocks.

If the char content is already available as a string or a char array, a `CharStream` can be directly constructed from the char buffer (without needing to copy the buffer). The overhead of accessing an in-memory char buffer through a `CharStream` is minimal.

[dl

[Position information]
[
The position of the next char in the stream is described by the following 4 properties:
- `Index`, the index of the UTF-16 char in the stream,
- `Line`, the line number for the next char,
- `LineBegin`, the index of the first char of the line that also contains the next char,
- `Name`, a description or identifier for the stream.

The `LineBegin` can be combined with the `Index` to calculate a `Column` number.

Among these properties the char index is the most important one, as the `CharStream` uses it to uniquely identify a UTF-16 char in the stream.

The other 3 properties further describe the text location of the char identified by the index, but they are not necessary for the core functionality of the `CharStream` class. The `CharStream` class keeps track of this additional position information to provide a more convenient interface to higher-level library functions, in particular to assist debugging and error reporting purposes.
]

[Newlines]
[
For performance reasons the most basic stream operations do *not* automatically recognize [url "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" newlines] (end-of-line markers) in the stream content. If you skip any newline with these methods, you have to manually register the newline afterwards with one of the [^RegisterNewline-methods `RegisterNewline` methods] (otherwise the line and column count becomes incorrect).

In order to provide a convenient interface for parser routines, the `CharStream` class also provides [^methods-that-register-newlines some more advanced methods] that automatically register any skipped standard newline (`"\n"`, `"\r\n"` and `"\r"`). Additionally, it provides two methods that automatically register any Unicode newline (`SkipUnicodeWhitespace` and `SkipUnicodeNewline`).

It should be obvious from the method names which methods automatically register newlines and which don't.
]

[#Case-insensitive matching#]
[
The `MatchCaseFolded` and `SkipCaseFolded` members match the content of the stream "case-insensitively" with a reference string. In this instance "case-insensitive" means that before the chars are matched with the reference string they are [url "http://unicode.org/reports/tr21/tr21-5.html#Caseless_Matching" mapped to a canonical form where case differences are erased]. For performance reasons `MatchCaseFolded` only applies the (non-Turkic) 1-to-1 [url  "http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/CaseFolding.txt" case folding mappings] (v. 6.1.0) for Unicode code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane, i.e. code points below 0x10000. These mappings are sufficient for many case-insensitive parser grammars encountered in practice, but they are not appropriate for matching arbitrary natural language content. Please also note that the `CharStream` class performs no Unicode [url "http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/" normalization].
]

[ #Non-sequential access#]
[
[small [/ This note does not apply to the [^low-trust Low-Trust version] of FParsec.]][br]
If you construct a `CharStream` from a `System.IO.Stream` or a file path and you backtrack over a distance long enough to require the `CharStream` to reread a previous block, then the underlying **byte stream needs to support seeking**, otherwise a `NotSupportedException` is thrown. Furthermore, the [** [^Decoder Decoder] for the input [^Encoding Encoding] must be serializable] if you backtrack to a block other than the first in the stream. Note that *file streams created for regular disk files are always seekable and all the .NET standard decoders are serializable*. In order to support non-seekable streams for applications which don't require extensive backtracking, no exception will be thrown before an operation actually requires backtracking and the necessary capabilities of the stream or decoder are not available.
]

[Decoder errors]
[
A `CharStream` constructed from a binary input stream decodes the input data with the help of a `Decoder` instance obtained via the `Encodings`'s `GetDecoder` method. Depending on the configuration of the encoding the decoder might throw an exception if it encounters invalid byte sequences, usually a `System.Text.DecoderFallbackException` or a `System.IO.ArgumentException`.
 [fn The detection of invalid byte sequences by the .NET decoders is not entirely reliable. For example, `System.Text.UnicodeEncoding` (UTF-16) has an alignment related bug in .NET versions prior to 4.0 that sometimes leads to invalid surrogate pairs not being detected. The implementations of more complicated encodings, like GB18030, ISO-2022 and ISCII, also have [url "https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=432648" several issues] with regard to the detection of invalid input data.]
]

[Disposable interface]
[
[small [/ This note does not apply to the [^low-trust Low-Trust version] of FParsec.]][br]
A `CharStream` holds managed and unmanaged resources that need to be explicitly released. Hence, it is very important that `CharStream` objects are promptly disposed after use. Where possible `CharStream` objects should only be used within a "using" block (C#), a "use" expression( F#) or similar constructs in other languages.
]

[Thread safety]
[
`CharStream` members are not thread-safe.
]

[[#low-trust Low-Trust version]]
[
If you compile FParsec with the `LOW_TRUST` conditional compiler symbol, the `CharStream` class differs from the normal version as follows:
- No [url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t2yzs44b.aspx" unverifiable code] involving pointers is used. *This allows FParsec to be executed in an environment with reduced trust*, such as medium trust ASP.NET applications or Silverlight applications.
- A `CharStream` that is constructed from a `System.IO.Stream` or a file path reads the complete file into a single string during construction. *This severely limits the maximum practical stream size.*
- Although the `CharStream` class still supports the `IDisposable` interface, disposing the `CharStream` instances is no longer necessary, since no resources are hold that need to be explicitly released.

[section#exceptions I/O exceptions]

If you construct a `CharStream` from a `System.IO.Stream` or a file path, the constructor and any `CharStream` operation that requires reading chars from the underlying byte stream may throw one of the following exceptions.

In the [^low-trust Low-Trust version], the constructor decodes the complete byte stream and hence only the constructor may throw one of these exceptions.

[note Doing actual work in a constructor and potentially throwing exceptions seems to be a somewhat controversial design. We think it's the right choice for the `CharStream` class, because this way you can a have a reasonable expectation that the `CharStream` actually works after you've successfully constructed it.]

In general it is *not* safe to continue to use a `CharStream` instance after one of these exceptions was thrown, though calling `Dispose()` is always safe.

[dl
[`[no-auto-link NotSupportedException]`]
[Seeking of the underlying byte stream is required, but the byte stream does not support seeking or the `Encoding`'s `Decoder` is not serializable. See also the remarks above on @non-sequential access@.]

[`[no-auto-link IOException]`]
[An I/O occurred while reading data from the underlying byte stream.]

[`[no-auto-link ArgumentException]`]
[The underlying byte stream contains invalid bytes and the `Encoding` was constructed with the `throwOnInvalidBytes` option.]

[`[no-auto-link DecoderFallbackException]`]
[The underlying byte stream contains invalid bytes for which the decoder fallback threw this exception.

The byte index of the invalid bytes in the stream is stored as a boxed `System.Int64` in the `"Stream.Position"` entry of the `[url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.exception.data.aspx" Data]` member of the exception instance. The precision of the index depends on the precision of the `DecoderFallbackException`'s `[url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.decoderfallbackexception.index.aspx" Index]` member. If the underlying `System.IO.Stream` is not seekable, the byte index only takes into account the bytes read by the `CharStream`, but not any bytes read before the `CharStream` was constructed.

[
The `StateTag`'s purpose is to provide an efficient way to determine whether the publically visible state of the `CharStream` has changed after a series of method calls. For the purpose of this property, the state is defined as the aggregate of the `Index`, `Line`, `LineBegin` and `Name` values. The `UserState` value of `CharStream<'UserState>` instances is also part of the `CharStream` state. If a method or property setter changes one or more of these state values it increments the `StateTag`'s by 1. Thus, to determine whether a series of method calls has changed the `CharStream`, it is often enough to compare the `StateTag` values from before and after the method calls.

The `StateTag` property is primarily meant for use in the implementation of parser combinators. If you directly call `CharStream` methods, you normally don't need the `StateTag` to determine whether the state has changed, because that is usually obvious from either the method's return value or the context in which it was called. Please see [^ users-guide.applying-parsers-in-sequence.the-statetag] for more details on the design rationale behind the `StateTag`.

[#Match_Regex

Applies the given regular expression to the stream chars beginning with the next char. Returns the resulting `Match` object.

For performance reasons you should specify the regular expression such that it can only match at the beginning of a string, for example by prepending `"\\A"`.

For `CharStream` instances constructed from strings the regular expression is applied to a string containing *all* the remaining chars in the stream.

For `CharStream` instances constructed from large binary streams (with more than 1 block) the regular expression is not applied to a string containing all the remaining chars in the stream. Here the `MinRegexSpace` value determines the *minimum* number of chars that are guaranteed to be visible to the regular expression (assuming there are still enough chars remaining in the stream). The exact number of chars visible to the regular expression may be affected even by calls to `CharStream` methods like `[^Peek_int Peek]` or `[^Match_string Match]` that otherwise guarantee to not change the (outwardly visible) state of the `CharStream`.

This method may throw any of the [^exceptions I/O related exceptions] detailed above.

If the `CharStream` was constructed from a `System.IO.Stream` or a file path, the regular expression is applied to an internal *mutable* buffer. Since  the `Match` object may work lazily, i.e. compute return values not before they are needed, you need to *retrieve all the required information from the `Match` object before you continue to access the `CharStream`*, otherwise you might get back invalid match results. Note that all strings returned by the `Match` object are, of course, immutable.]

The value must be non-negative and not greater than `BlockOverlap`. The default value is 2/3 of `BlockOverlap`.

If the `CharStream` is constructed from a string, char array or char pointer or has only 1 block, then this value has no relevance and calling the property setter has no effect. (No [^low-trust Low-Trust version] `CharStream` instance has more than 1 block.)

The `MinRegexSpace` value is not recorded in `CharStreamState` instances and setting its value does not affect the `StateTag`.

If this method skips no chars because the next stream char is no newline char, it returns -1. Otherwise it returns the indentation of the first line with non-whitespace characters.

The *indentation* is calculated as follows:
- Any newline char (`'\r'` or `'\n'`) or form feed char (`'\f'`) resets the *indentation* to 0.
- Any space char (`' '`) increments the *indentation* by 1.
- Any tab char (`'\t'`) increments the *indentation* by[br] `powerOf2TabStopDistance` - (*indentation* modulo `powerOf2TabStopDistance`).

The maximum indentation is 2[sup 31] - 1. If skipping a whitespace char would cause the indentation to overflow, the char is not skipped and the method returns the indentation up to that char.

An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if `powerOf2TabStopDistance` is not a positive power of 2.

[
Skips over all stream chars before the first occurrence of the specified string or the end of the stream, but not over more than `maxCount` chars.
Assigns `true` to the output parameter if the string is found, otherwise `false`.

This method registers skipped newlines (`"\n"`, `"\r\n"` or `"\r"`) and counts them as single chars. However, no newline normalization takes place when the argument string `str` is matched with the stream chars. Hence, `str` should either contain no newlines or only in the form they occur in the stream.
If `str` starts with `'\n'`, then `SkipCharsOrNewlinesUntilString` will not find occurences of `str` in the stream that start in the middle of an `"\r\n"` newline.

[$$interface]
[/section]
[section Remarks]

The `CharStream<'TUserState>` class adds a user definable state component to its base class `CharStream`.

The user state is accessible through the property `UserState`. It has the type `'TUserState`.

You can retrieve a snapshot of the complete stream state, including the user state, from the `State` property. The value returned from the `State` property has the type `CharStreamState<'TUserState>`. You can pass a `CharStreamState` value to the `BacktrackTo` method in order to restore a previous state of the `CharStream`.

[important
`'TUserState` must be an immutable type or at least be treated as an immutable type if you want `BacktrackTo` to completely restore old values of the user state. Hence, when you need to change the user state, you should set a new `'TUserState` value to the `UserState` property of the `CharStream` instance, *not* mutate the existing `'TUserState` value.

Creates a new `CharStream<'TUserState>` instance with the stream chars between the index of the `stateWhereSubstreamBegins` (inclusive) and the current `Index` of the stream (exclusive).

The state of the substream is initialized to `stateWhereSubstreamBegin`, so that the stream and the substream will report the same  position (`Index`, `Line`, `LineBegin` and `Name`) for corresponding chars.
However, the beginning and end will normally differ between stream and substream, in particular the `IndexOfFirstChar` and `IndexOfLastCharPlus1` values will normally differ between stream and substream.

[note
[/ This note does not apply to the [^low-trust Low-Trust version] of FParsec.][br]
If you create a substream for a `CharStream` instance with more than one block, the content of the substream needs to be copied. Thus, you can minimize the overhead associated with creating a substream by ensuring that the `CharStream` has only one block, either by choosing a sufficiently large `blockSize`, or by creating the `CharStream` from a string or char buffer.]

You may use a stream and its substreams concurrently. However, notice the following warning:

[caution
[/ This note does not apply to the [^low-trust Low-Trust version] of FParsec.][br]
You may not dispose a stream before all of its substreams are disposed.
Disposing a stream before all its substreams are disposed triggers an assert exception in debug builds and otherwise lead to undefined behaviour.]
