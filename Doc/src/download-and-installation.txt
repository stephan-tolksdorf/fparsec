[section Download and installation]

FParsec is distributed in source code form and as NuGet packages.

If you're new to FParsec, I'd recommend to start by downloading the [url "https://bitbucket.org/fparsec/main/get/tip.zip" source code package] and experimenting a bit with the included sample projects. With the Visual Studio project and solution files (e.g. in the [=Build/VS11] subfolder) building the library and the samples is as easy as clicking a button.

The source package also includes a complete copy of the HTML documentation for offline viewing.

To use FParsec in your own projects, you just need to reference the =FParsecCS.dll= and =FParsec.dll= assemblies produced by the FParsec project files. Alternatively, you can use the [url "http://nuget.org" NuGet package manager] to download precompiled FParsec assemblies and setup the references.

[section NuGet packages]

There are two NuGet packages of FParsec, which are built with different configuration options.

The [url "http://nuget.org/packages/FParsec" basic package] uses the @Low-Trust version@ of FParsec, which uses no [url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t2yzs44b.aspx" unverifiable code] and is optimized for maximum portability. The main limitation of this version is that any input stream is completely read into a string before parsing, which limits the maximum practical input size.

The [url "http://nuget.org/packages/FParsec-Big-Data-Edition/" "Big Data edition" package] uses the non-Low-Trust version of FParsec that is optimized for maximum performance and supports extremely large input streams. Since this configuration is also the default configuration of the solution files included with the source code, it is sometimes referred to as the "normal" version of FParsec. This version of FParsec does use "unsafe" (i.e. unverifiable) code involving unmanaged pointers. It also uses code generation in the implementation of `isAnyOf`, `isNoneOf`, `anyOf`, `skipAnyOf`, `noneOf` and `skipNoneOf`.

You can find the precise @configuration options@ used to built the two NuGet packages below. Should you measure a significant performance /degradation/ when switching to the Big Data edition, you're probably inadvertently recreating the same `isAnyOf`- or `isNoneOf`-based parsers again and again, as explained [^construct-parsers-once here] and [^why-the-monadic-syntax-is-slow here].

The NuGet packages are strongly signed. Their assembly version numbers will only be incremented for breaking changes.

For every published FParsec NuGet package a corresponding [url "http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-symbol-package" symbol package] with PDBs and source files is uploaded to [url "http://www.symbolsource.org/" SymbolSource.org]. So, if you enable source server support in the Visual Studio debugging options and [url "http://www.symbolsource.org/Public/Home/VisualStudio" configure] symbolsource.org as a symbol server, you can step into the FParsec code in the debugger.

[section Getting the source]

FParsec's source code repository is hosted on BitBucket at: [url "https://bitbucket.org/fparsec/main" bitbucket.org/fparsec/main]

You can "clone" the source code using [url "http://mercurial.selenic.com/" Mercurial (HG)] or you can [url "https://bitbucket.org/fparsec/main/get/tip.zip" download it as a zip-file].

It's an FParsec project policy to check only stable and tested code into the BitBucket repository, so you can normally just work with the "tip" version of FParsec.

[tip
[url "http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/" TortoiseHG] is a great Mercurial GUI for Windows.

[section FParsec is built as two DLLs]

FParsec's source code is written in both C# and F#. Since neither the C# nor the F# compiler directly support the other language, the respective components need to be built separately.

Hence, FParsec is built as two DLLs. The C# bits are compiled into the =FParsecCS.dll= and the F# bits (which depend on the C# bits) are compiled into =FParsec.dll=.

*Projects that use FParsec thus have to reference both DLLs.*

If you reference the DLLs in the [@ F# Interactive] console, you need to reference `FParsecCS.dll` before you reference `FParsec.dll`.

[note If you don't want to distribute the FParsec DLLs together with the assembly of your project, you can use the [url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233171.aspx" =staticlink= command-line option] of the F# compiler to merge the FParsec DLLs into your assembly.

Unfortunately, the same option cannot be used to merge =FParsecCS.dll= into the =FParsec.dll=, as the public definitions in =FParsecCS.dll= wouldn't be reexported by =FParsec.dll=. For similar reasons it also doesn't seem to be possible to use tools like [url "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ILMerge.aspx" ILMerge] or [url "http://code.google.com/p/il-repack/" il-repack] to obtain a merged =FParsec.dll= that can be properly consumed by F# programs.
]

[section Building FParsec with Visual Studio]

The folders [= Build/VS9], [= Build/VS10] and [= Build/VS11] contain solution files for Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012. The folder [= Build/Silverlight] contains a Visual Studio 2010 solution specifically configured to produce Silverlight 4-compatible assemblies.

When you build FParsec with these solution files, the compiled assemblies will be put into the [= bin/Debug] or [= bin/Release] subfolders, depending on the project configuration. For example, the VS10 solution will put the assemblies into the folders [= Build/VS10/bin/Debug] and [= Build/VS10/bin/Release].

The =Test= project in the solution files contains the unit tests for FParsec.

[section Building FParsec with Mono]

[*This information is this section might be partially out-of-date. Please [url "https://bitbucket.org/fparsec/main/issues/new" file a documentation bug] if you can provide more up-to-date information.]

FParsec is compatible with the latest version of Mono from the [url "https://github.com/mono/mono" GitHub] =master= branch (the =2.10= branch is missing at least commit [url "https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/410b3e423f1135a9783d" 410b3e423f1135a9783d] for FParsec to compile).

You can build FParsec for Mono using the =Makefile= in the =Build= directory. The debug and release assemblies will be put in the [= Build/bin/Debug] and [= Build/bin/Release] directories respectively.

Mono's `[no-auto-link System.Text.Decoder]` classes have some bugs that cause issues with FParsec.  Until these bugs are fixed only the @Low-Trust version@ of FParsec works under Mono.

Note:
- Mono [url "https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480178" currently doesn't properly support] Unicode code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (i.e. code points above 0xffff). This breaks FParsec's `identifier` parser, for example. *(Note: The linked ticket has been closed in the meantime, so the issue might have been fixed since the last time I checked.)*
- The `regex` parser and the `[^Match_Regex CharStream.Match](Regex)` method curently don't work on Mono, because Mono's regular expression implementation [url "https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=474154" does not correctly match regexes on substrings] (Laurent Le Brun reported this issue - thanks Laurent!).

[/section]

[section#low-trust-version The Low-Trust version of FParsec]

For optimization reasons the normal implementation (the "Big Data edition") of FParsec involves [url "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t2yzs44b.aspx" unverifiable code] using unmanaged pointers.

If you compile FParsec with the `LOW_TRUST` conditional compiler symbol, the unverifiable code is replaced with a "safe" alternative. This allows FParsec to be run in environments with "reduced trust", such as medium trust ASP.NET applications or Silverlight applications.

The next section explains how you can set a conditional compiler symbol. If you want to use the Low-Trust version of FParsec, you need to compile each of the `FParsecCS`, `FParsec` and `Test` projects with the `LOW_TRUST` symbol.

The Low-Trust version of FParsec has the following two major limitations:
- A `CharStream` that is constructed from a `System.IO.Stream` or a file path reads the complete file into a single string during construction. *This severely limits the maximum practical input stream size.*
- The `StaticMapping` module is not supported.

[/section]


[section Configuration options]

You can configure FParsec's source code with a number of conditional compilation symbols (a.k.a. preprocessor defines). Besides the [^low-trust-version Low-Trust option], these symbols mostly serve tuning purposes. The Visual Studio solutions and the Mono Makefile both come with sensible defaults, so that you don't have to worry about these options if you don't want to.

You can set conditional compilation symbols either in the Visual Studio project configuration in the "Build" tab (multiple symbols can be separated by semicolons) or on the compiler command-line with the [= /define:SYMBOL] option (the F# compiler requires a separate [= /define:] option for each symbol).

The [url "http://nuget.org/packages/FParsec" basic] NuGet package is built with the following options:[br]`LOW_TRUST`, `SMALL_STATETAG`, `CLR4`

The [url "http://nuget.org/packages/FParsec-Big-Data-Edition" "Big Data edition"]  package is built with the following options:[br]`USE_STATIC_MAPPING_FOR_IS_ANY_OF`, `UNALIGNED_READS`, `CLR4`, `CLR45`.

[dl Options for =FParsecCS.dll=

[`LOW_TRUST`]
[See [^low-trust-version above].]

[`CLR4`]
[Compile for a CLR version ≥ 4.]

[`#CLR45#`]
[
Compile for a CLR version ≥ 4.5.

This option allows annotating methods with the new `MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining` attribute.
]

[`SILVERLIGHT`]
[Compile for Silverlight.]

[`SMALL_STATETAG`]
[
Use a 32-bit `StateTag` in the `CharStream` class instead of the default 64-bit one.

This is an optimization for 32-bit runtimes. You can find more information about the state tag in [^ users-guide.applying-parsers-in-sequence.the-statetag] of the user's guide.
]

[`#UNALIGNED_READS#`]
[
[small [/ This option does not affect the @Low-Trust version@ of FParsec.]][br]

Optimize for CPUs that support fast unaligned memory reads, i.e. any modern x86-based CPU.

This option only makes a noticeable difference is some specific situations.
]

]

[dl Options for =FParsec.dll=

[`LOW_TRUST`]
[See [^low-trust-version above].]

[`[no-auto-link UNALIGNED_READS]`]
[
See [^UNALIGNED_READS above].
]

[`NOINLINE`]
[
Do not force inlining of certain parser combinators.

This option enables you to step through the respective combinators during debugging.
]

[`#USE_STATIC_MAPPING_FOR_IS_ANY_OF#`]
[
[small [/ This option does not affect the @Low-Trust version@ of FParsec.]][br]

Use `StaticMapping.createStaticCharIndicatorFunction` for the implementation of `isAnyOf`, `isNoneOf`, `anyOf`, `skipAnyOf`, `noneOf` and `skipNoneOf` for generating optimized char predicate functions using runtime code generation.

Runtime code generation is a relatively expensive operation, so this optimization is primarily meant for parsers that are applied to large (or lots of) input streams. Please see the remarks for the `StaticMapping` module for more information.

If you run into noticeable performance problems or memory leaks when enabling this option, you're probably inadvertently recreating the same `isAnyOf`- or `isNoneOf`-based parser again and again, as explained [^construct-parsers-once here] and [^why-the-monadic-syntax-is-slow here].
]

[`DEBUG_STATIC_MAPPING` ]
[
[small [/ This option does not affect the @Low-Trust version@ of FParsec.]][br]
