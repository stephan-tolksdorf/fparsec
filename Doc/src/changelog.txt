[[# Removed variants of `many`, `sepBy`, `sepEndBy` and `manyTill`]]
[
The `...Rev`, `...Fold` and `...Reduce` variants of `many`, `sepBy`, `sepEndBy`and `manyTill` have been removed.

If you previously used these variants, you can easily define them in your own code using the `|>>` combinator, as documented in the reference documentation for the previous version. For example:
``
let manyRev p = many p |>> List.rev
let manyFold acc0 f p = many p |>> List.fold f acc0
let manyReduce f defVal p = (many1 p |>> List.reduce f) <|>% defVal.
``

If you need *optimized* implementations, you can define them using the new `Inline` helper class.
The file [url "https://bitbucket.org/fparsec/main/src/tip/Doc/misc/removed-many-variants.fs" [= Doc/misc/removed-many-variants.fs]] contains optimized definitions for all removed variants.
]


[[# Details on changes to `manyChars`, `manyCharsTill` and their variants]]
[
The behaviour of all variants of `manyChars` and `manyCharsTill` has slightly changed. Now
`manyChars cp` is equivalent to `many cp`, except that it returns a string instead of char list. Previously, `manyChars cp` behaved like `many (attempt cp)`, i.e. it automatically backtracked if the char parser had failed after consuming input. The same change has been made to the behaviour of all other variants of `manyChars` and `manyCharsTill`. The new behaviour is more consistent with the rest of the libary and allows a faster implementation with the new low-level API.

There probably aren't many parsers that relied on the old behaviour.

The behaviour change made the `skip` variants of `manyChar` and `manyCharsTill` obsolete, since e.g. `skipManyChars` would do exactly the same as `skipMany cp`. [#removed-skip-variants-of-manyChars Hence, the `skip` variants have been removed].
]

[[# Changes to low-level API]]
[
- The old `[no-auto-link CharStream]` and `[no-auto-link State]` classes have been merged into a single `CharStream` class with a mutable interface.
- `Parser` functions now take a `[^CharStream_1 CharStream<'u>\ ]` instance as the input argument.
- The `Reply` type has been moved to the main `FParsec` namespace and no longer has a `[no-auto-link State]` member.
- Parser state comparisons are now done with the help of the `CharStream`'s `StateTag`.
- Various methods from the old `[no-auto-link CharStream.Iterator]` and `[no-auto-link State]` types have been renamed in the new `CharStream` class and have new signatures:
  - When you adapt old code, the following changes **require particular attention**:
     - the old `[no-auto-link Iterator.Read]` methods *did not* advance the input stream position, but the new `CharStream.Read` now *do* (as is the expected behaviour in traditional stream classes)
     - the old `[no-auto-link Read]()` is equivalent to the new `Peek()`
     - the old `[no-auto-link Read](int)` is equivalent to the new `PeekString(int)`
     - the old `[no-auto-link Peek]()` is equivalent to the new (and old) `[^Peek_int Peek](1)`
  - More renamings:
    - `Next`, `Advance` ? `[^Skip-members Skip]`
    - `_Increment`, `_Decrement` ? `[^SkipAndPeek-members SkipAndPeek]`
    - `[no-auto-link SkipRestOfLine]` with string output ? `ReadRestOfLine`
    - `SkipCharOrNewlines` with string output ? `ReadCharsOrNewlines`
    - `SkipToString` ? `[^SkipCharsOrNewlinesUntilString-members SkipCharsOrNewlinesUntilString]`
    - `SkipToStringCI` ? `[^SkipCharsOrNewlinesUntilCaseFoldedString-members SkipCharsOrNewlinesUntilCaseFoldedString]`
    - `ReadUntil` ? `ReadFrom`
    - `[no-auto-link CharStream.FoldCase]` ? `Text.FoldCase`
    - `[no-auto-link CharStream.NormalizeNewlines]` ? `Text.NormalizeNewlines`
- New `CharStream` methods:
  - `[^Skip-members Skip]` methods with char and string arguments
  - `SkipUnicodeWhitespace`
  - `SkipNewlineThenWhitespace`
- The `ErrorMessage` and `ErrorMessageList` types are now defined in the C# library part. This allows us to implement full parsers in C#.
  The `FParsec.Error` module contains type abbreviations and active patters that provide the familiar interface to F# clients.
- All error messages used by built-in FParsec parsers are now defined in the C# classes `FParsec.Strings` and `FParsec.Errors`. This should simplify customization and internationalization efforts.

]

[[# Background on low-level API changes]]
[
Previously parsers were implemented as functions operating on an immutable parser state in the form of a `State` instance. A parser function received a `State` instance as the input and returned a `State` instance as part of its return value. Since `State` instances were immutable, a parser function had to create a new `State` instance to advance the input stream, e.g. by calling `state.Advance(2)`.

This architecture was motivated by the desire to provide an API as "functional" as possible, an API that shields users from the underlying imperative/mutable nature of input streams. When FParsec originally started as a relatively close port of Haskell's Parsec library, this design felt like a natural fit for a functional parser library. However, later, when FParsec moved away from its Parsec roots (to improve performance and provide more features), it became increasingly clear that the immutable `CharStream`-`State`-design was the main obstacle preventing FParsec from reaching the performance of hand-optimized recursive-descent parsers.

Initial tests with some quick prototypes revealed that the allocation and garbage collection of temporary `State` instances took up to 50% or more of the run time of typical parsers -- even though the `State` class was already heavily optimized. These tests also indicated that consolidating the stream and state classes into a classical imperative stream class simplified the overall library implementation and made the library source code more accessible to new users.

The main drawback of the API change is that it requires modifications to practically all low-level parser code. Another drawback is that backtracking is slightly less convenient with the new low-level API (as the parser state has to be explicitly saved and restored, while previously one could just continue with an old state instance).

Since FParsec's high-level API is only minimally affected by the change, the advantages seem to outweigh the costs.

[section#v0_8_x Version 0.8.x, no release]
[dl
[New features/ improvements]
[
- case-insensitive matching with `pstringCI`, `charsTillStringCI`, etc.
  (using the Unicode 1-to-1 case folding mappings for chars in the BMP)
- various new parsers and combinators, including `restOfLine`,
  `skipToString`, `manySatisfyMinMax`, `manyStrings`, `withSkippedString`
- new functions `runParserOnSubstring` and `runParserOnSubstream`
- various performance improvements
- Silverlight support
- F# 1.9.6.16 compatibility
]

[Design changes]
[
- standardized on a single input stream type (`FParsec.CharStream`)
  and a single concrete parser state type (`FParsec.State`)
- refactored the `Reply<_,_>`, `ErrorMessage` and `ParserError` types:
  * error replies now also contain a complete `State`
  * whether a parser has changed the state is now determined by
    checking the input and the output state for equality, instead of testing
    the `Consumed` flag
  * replaced the `Reply<_,_>.Flags` with a `Status` field
  * replaced the various helper functions for constructing a `Reply` with
    three overloaded `Reply<_,_>` constructors (with different arities)
- all char parsers are now "newline aware", i.e. they normalize
  any of the three standard newline representations (`"\n"`, `"\r\n"`, `"\r"`)
  to "\n" and they properly increment the line count whenever they parse
  a newline; **this means that the behaviour of almost all char parsers has
  changed with regard to how newline chars are handled**
]
[Bug fixes]
[
- The `CharStream` class now uses the serialization API to persist the decoder
  state for backtracking purposes. Previously it relied on the decoder loosing
  its state at block boundaries after a certain sequence of method calls. The
  previous approach works in practice for the .NET decoders of the standard
  unicode encodings and for simple stateless encodings like ASCII and ANSI,
  but it relies on undocumented behaviour and it does not work reliably for
  encodings like GB18030, ISO-2022 or ISCII.
- In previous FParsec versions the `CharStream` file path/System.IO.Stream
  constructors failed with an `IndexOutOfRange` exception when the file/stream
  was empty and encoding detection was not turned off
  (reported by Vesa Karvonen - thanks Vesa!).
- In previous FParsec versions the `NumberLiteral.String` returned by the
  `numberLiteral` parser included parsed suffix chars despite the
  documentation claiming the opposite. (The testing code was buggy too.)
  Applications that rely on this behaviour can now use the new
  `NumberLiteralOptions.IncludeSuffixCharsInString` to force the
  `numberLiteral` parser to include any suffix chars in the returned string.
- Fixed behaviour of `>>=?`, `>>?` and `.>>?` when second parser fails with fatal error without changing the parser state.
- Fixed behaviour of `nextCharSatisfies[Not]` when current "char" is a `"\r\n"` newline.
]

[Other breaking changes]
[
- renamed the module `CharParser` to `CharParsers`
- moved `CharParser.OperatorPrecedenceParser` into separate module

- `FParsec.Primitives`:
  * **subtle change:** renamed `message` to `fail` and `fail` to `failFatally`
  * renamed `pair`, `triple` and `quad` to `tuple2`, `tuple3` and `tuple4`
  * renamed `manyFoldLeft` to `manyFold` and changed the
    argument order of the accumulator and function argument
  * removed `manyFoldRight`
  * renamed `count` to `parray` and changed the return type,
    renamed `skipCount` to `skipArray`
  * renamed `followedBy` and `notFollowedBy` to `followedByL` and
    `notFollowedByL` and introduced `followedBy` and `notFollowedBy` functions
    that take no second argument
  * moved `ParserResult<_>` to `CharParsers` and changed constructor arguments
  * removed applyParser
  * removed `|>>=`, now `>>=` automatically uses an optimized branch for
    uncurried functions
  * removed `endBy` and `endBy1` (`endBy p sep` can be replaced with
    `many (p .>> sep)` and `endBy1 p sep` with `many1 (p .>> sep)`)

- `FParsec.CharParsers`:
  * renamed `manyTillString` to `charsTillString`
  * removed `applyParser` from the public interface
  * removed `getIndex`, `skip`, `registerNL`, `extract`, `regexp`
    (these low-level operations should be done directly through the
    `State<_>`/`CharStream.Iterator` interface)
  * removed `anyCharOrNL` (no longer needed, see design changes above)
  * removed `nSatisfy` (can be replaced with `manySatisfyMinMax`)
  * removed `unicodeDigit` and `unicodeNumber` (can be replaced with
    `satisfy System.Char.IsDigit` and `satisfy System.Char.IsNumber`)
  * moved the helper functions `expectedError`, `unexpectedError` etc. into
    the `Error` module

- `FParsec.CharStream`:
  * string constructor takes more arguments
  * `Iterator.Peek(i)` now returns the `EndOfStreamChar` char instead
    of throwing an exception if the char peeked at lies before the beginning
    of the stream

[section#v0_7_3_1 Version 0.7.3.1, 2009-02-26]
- Fixed a bug in `CharParser.normalizeNewlines`/`CharStream.NormalizeNewlines`.
  This bug also affected the `skipped` and `manyTillString` parsers, which
  internaly call `normalizeNewlines` to normalize the returned string.

  The bug was reported by Greg Chapman - thanks Greg!

  When given a multi-line string in which the lines are delimited by `"\r\n"` but
  the last line does not end in a newline, the buggy `normalizeNewlines`
  replaced the chars on the last line with `'\n'` chars.

- Changed the signature of `Helper.SkipOverWhitespace`.
[/section]

[section#v0_7_3 Version 0.7.3, 2008-12-08]
Breaking changes (all of which should have little or no impact
on existing code bases):
- `CharStream.Iterator` instances now compare equal if and only if they belong
  to the same `CharStream` and point to the same index (previously they
  compared only equal if their internal representations were identical)
- the constructor argument of `Error.otherError` is now expected to be
  comparable with F#'s structural comparison function `compare`,
  see http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785725
- the signature of the second `ParserError.ToString` overload has changed
- `CharParser.errorToString` and `printErrorLine` have been deprecated

New features:
- reimplemented the error formatting code in `FParsec.Error`
- added new `State<_>.AdvanceTo` and `CharStream.Iterator.Advance` overloads
- slightly modified the error reporting in `Primitives.sepEndBy`
- some documentation fixes
[/section]

[section#v0_7_2 Version 0.7.2, 2008-11-17]
- added `CharParser.OperatorPrecedenceParser`
- changed the overflow checking in `pint32` such that it will
  not be affected by an expected future change in F#'s
  `int32 -> uint64` conversion behaviour
- added `CharParser.pint16`, `puint16`, `pint8`, `puint8`
- changed the signatures in CharParser.fsi to use the `Parser<_,_>` type
  abbreviation
- fixed outdated documentation of `CharParser.expectedError`
- some minor optimizations
[/section]

[section#v0_7_1 Version 0.7.1, 2008-09-29]

[/section]

[section#v0_7_0_1 Version 0.7.0.1, 2008-09-23]
Breaking change:
- changed the case of the `FParsec.Error.Pos` members
  (This wasn't already done in 0.7 because of an oversight.)
[/section]

[section#v0_7 Version 0.7.0, 2008-09-13]
Bugfixes:
- made `FParsec.Error.Pos` IComparable to prevent `ParserError.ToString`
  from throwing an exception under rare circumstances
- corrected the argument checking for some `CharStream.Iterator` methods
  for very large arguments

New features:
- compatibility with the F# CTP release
- a configurable parser for number literals: `CharParser.numberLiteral`
- `CharParser.pfloat` now also parses `NaN`, `Infinity` and
  hexadecimal floating point literals as supported by IEEE754r, C99 and
  Java (but different from the hex representation supported by F#)
- new helper functions `CharParser.floatToHexString`, `floatOfHexString`,
  `float32ToHexString` and  `float32OfHexString`
- integer parsers: `Charparser.pint32`, `puint64`, `puint32`, `puint64`

- new `CharStream.Iterator` members `ReadUntil`, `Increment` and `Decrement`
- new `State` member `AdvanceTo`
- new function `Primitives.createParserForwardedToRef`
- new combinator `|>>=` in `Primitives`

Breaking changes:
- renamed the parsers `char` and `string` to `pchar` and `pstring`
  (This is in deference to the built-in F# functions `char`
   and `string`, which weren't yet around when the first version
   of FParsec was released.)
- changed the case of the properties of the `Reply` and `State` types
  (This reflects the emerging consensus in the F# community that all
   public members of types should be named in PascalCase.)
- deprecated `State.AdvanceNL` (use the 3 parameter Advance overload instead)
- deprecated the `Primitives` helper functions `isOk`, `isEmpty`, ...
  (the `Reply` properties `IsOk`, `IsEmpty`,... should be used instead)

  (the `State.Iter` methods `Match`, `Read`, ... should be used instead)
- deprecated `Primitives.option`, `<|>$` should be used instead
- made `CharParser.CharList` internal (If you need this helper class for
  your code, just copy the implementation to your source.)
- `State.Flags()` now has more bits (and less bits are reset on a position change)
[/section]

- fixed a bug in `manyTillString` (the code keeping track of newlines was
  buggy)
- fixed a bug in `CharParser.<?>` (the error reporting was inconsistent with

- added `skipped` parser to `CharParser`
- added `nextCharSatifiesNot`, `prevCharSatifiesNot`,
